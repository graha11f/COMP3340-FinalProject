        31) After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the feelings of animosity in America against Japan increased. By late 1945, the Allied leaders met in Germany with news of a secret new weapon, called the atomic bomb, created by American scientists, that was powerful enough to destroy an entire city. However, there were some feelings that the bomb was too powerful, and the leaders chose instead to send the Potsdam Declaration to Japan warning them to surrender. The Japanese military did not know about the atomic bomb and ignored the warning, so on August 6th 1945, an American bomber called the Enola Gay was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. This blast killed an approximated 70,000 people and destroyed more than eighty percent of the city, but the Japanese still did not surrender. The US dropped a second atomic bomb, and after a furious debate in the Japanese cabinet, the emperor of Japan announced a surrender. This day on the 14th of August became known as V-J Day, for Victory over Japan.
        
        
        
        32) a & b) The approach to bring discrimination cases before the courts that I would have disagreed with most would have been using violence to gain attention. This approach only caused an uproar that required law enforcement and resulted in injuries of many people. Although it did bring attention, it brought the wrong sort of attention that they were seeking. The courts possibly would have been less eager to see their cases after acts of violence, since it only demonstrated rebellion.
        
        
        
        33) a & b) President Lyndon Johnson proposed the development of a plan called the Great Society, which was a plan with an ambitious goal to improve the standard of living of every American. One of these important Great Society programs was Medicare. This plan helped to pay the hospital bills of citizens over the age of 65. Similar to this program, Medicaid gave states money to help poor people of all ages with medical bills. Along with this, he fought to help Americans who lived below the poverty line. The Economic Opportunity Act was passed in 1964 to set up job-training programs for the poor. It also gave loans to businesses poor sections of the cities and offered loans to poor farmers.

        Justification of the Atomic Bomb
        Opinion Essay
        On August 6, 1945, the United States of America dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. For a considerable amount of time, there have been debates and arguments about whether or not dropping the bomb was justified.. The United States was indeed justified because of the attacks by Japan on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, which happened three years before the atomic bomb falling on Hiroshima. It was important to stop the war as soon as the US could because it spared many American, and Allied lives. Until that point in World War Two, there had never been any battle that took place in the US. Women, men, and children had no reason to stress over being killed in their own country until the date that lays dark in US history, December 7, 1941, the ambush of Pearl Harbor. On that day, the Japanese brought forth and aerial attack featuring 423 planes, touching base in Pearl Harbor, which lead to the death 2,403 and wounding 1,178. Hitting eighteen American ships, it almost completely disabled the United States Navy in one day. Unknown to many citizens, the attack obliterated 180 fighter planes utilized as a part of the US Air Force. Due to the unjustified Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, it is without a doubt that the atomic bombs falling on Hiroshima, and Nagasaki, Japan, were indeed justified.

        Lyndon Johnson's Great Society
        Explanatory Essay
        The Great Society of Lyndon Baines Johnson as he put it “rests on abundance and liberty for all. It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice.” As former President Johnson said in the speech that he gave on may 22nd in 1964, President Johnson believed in this society that would unite the United States of America, and in doing so it would inspire the world to perhaps follow in his footsteps. President Johnson had derived much of this from being influenced greatly by Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal that he admired. Johnson 's Great Society program revolved around the idea that the United States as a country needed to create domestic programs that had to improve the quality of life for all of America and its people, and this was to be done

        Hiroshima Argumentative Essay
        Opinion Essay
        The world cried and wept for an end to World War II. All of the endless slaughter,fighting,and violence needed to stop. With one last nation,not standing, on its knees was struggling to continue the war. This nation was Japan. The people of Japan were suffering the burden of having a communist government and they were waiting for an end for World War II also. The United States had just that, an ending for World War Two. This ending came in the form of a 9,700 pound bomb called “Little Boy”. This Atomic Bomb was dropped upon the people of Hiroshima on the day of August 6, 1945 at exactly 8:15am, a Monday. It has been argued that we should or shouldn't have dropped the bomb on Hiroshima due to the after effects of the bomb. But I believe that dropping the Atomic Bomb had more benefits rather than the outcomes that would have occurred if we hadn't.

        Ronald Takakis Hiroshima
        Opinion Essay
        The United States entered WW II immediately following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The U.S. entry was a major turning point in the war because it brought the strongest industrial strength to the Allied side. The Americans helped the Allies to win the war in Europe with the surrender of Germany on May 7, 1945. However, the war in the Pacific continued. The war with Japan at this point consisted primarily of strategic bombings. America had recently completed an atomic bomb and was considering using this weapon of mass destruction for the first time. The goal was to force the “unconditional surrender” of the Japanese. Roosevelt had used the term “unconditional surrender” in a press conference in 1943 and it had since become a central war aim. Truman and his staff (still feeling bound by FDR’s words) demanded unconditional surrender from the Japanese. Consequently on July 26, 1945 Truman issued an ultimatum to Japan. This ultimatum stated that Japan must accept “unconditional surrender” or suffer “utter devastation of the Japanese Homeland”. This surrender included abdication of the throne by their emperor. Japan was not willing to surrender their dynasty and ignored the ultimatum. On August 6th and August 9th, atomic bombs were dropped on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki respectively.
